        description: 'A gem by the Taj Group, the Taj Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad redefines royalty and luxury. It’s the erstwhile palace of the Nizam, who was once the richest man in the world. Just like the royals, guests arrive at the hotel in a horse-drawn carriage and are pampered with excellent hospitality. The spectacular welcome ritual also includes a flower petal shower as you ascend the grand staircase.',
